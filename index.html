I used to write my Html code in a code editor named Brackets but now since we have started Javascript now we write in a new code editor which is named Visual Studio Code. I will be honest at the start i found Visual Studio code a bit hard to operate then when i started writing some code in it i understood how it works. I have only done two projects in Visual Syudio code and i really like it.";
